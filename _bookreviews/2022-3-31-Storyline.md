Cool plots to think of:

3 Gentlemen in Mumbai

1. Software guy with tonnes of money : No friends. Singer.
2. Cricket Coach : Disappointment to fam. drummer.
3. Unsuccessful writer : Marriage issues. Excellent song writer. Guitarist.

All meet while trying to jump off a bridge. Trying to convince each other to not jump off the bridge. Give each other 1 year's time to not be failure.

All 3 want restart. Go to random country and chill. So they decide to rob a bank in Mumbai. Make a plan, somehow satire works out, and they end up in the same location as before, but this time not wanting to kill themselves.
