I'm a first year Master's student at NYU's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences focused on Applied Mathematics and Scientific Computing.

I primarily interested professionally in Computer Vision and Computational Statistics.

I've previously worked in Computational Materials Science research with Prof M.P. Gururajan and Prof Hina Gokhale at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay), which resulted in my [thesis](https://adithyaiyer1999.github.io/AdithyaIyer_Thesis.pdf) and a paper [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12046-022-02036-5). We've also created the first computer vision based python library to track binary microstructures and perform statistical analysis (correlations, precipitate counts/growth etc.) titled MiST. The library for mist with a tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/adithyaiyer1999/mist).

I've also been involved with the European Space Agency's Copernicus Accelerator, where we attempted to solve agricultural problems with remote sensing. More information about us can be found [here](https://accelerator.copernicus.eu/portfolio/budnip/#:~:text=Budnip%20uses%20Copernicus%20Sentinel%20data,indicate%20a%20crop%20disease%20outbreak.&text=Budnip%20was%20the%20winning%20team,Copernicus%20Masters%20University%20Challenge%202020.)
We were officially 3rd in the Copernicus Masters University Challenge!

I'm also an avid follower of FC Barcelona, and have travelled over 15 countries, and have stayed in Europe for a semester on exchange too!

Feel free to ping me anytime!
