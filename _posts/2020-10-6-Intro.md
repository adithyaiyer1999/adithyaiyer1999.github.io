title: About me!
---

I'm a final year Undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. I primarily interested professionally in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning. I'm also involved with the European Space Agency's Copernicus Accelerator, where we're attempting to solve agricultural problems with remote sensing. More information about us can be found [here.](https://accelerator.copernicus.eu/portfolio/budnip/#:~:text=Budnip%20uses%20Copernicus%20Sentinel%20data,indicate%20a%20crop%20disease%20outbreak.&text=Budnip%20was%20the%20winning%20team,Copernicus%20Masters%20University%20Challenge%202020.)

I'm also an avid follower of FC Barcelona, and have travelled over 15 countries, and have stayed in Europe for a semester on exchange too!

Feel free to ping me anytime!

PS: We are now also officially 3rd in the Copernicus Masters University Challenge!
