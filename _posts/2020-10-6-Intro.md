title: About me!
---

I'm a final year Undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. I primarily interested professionally in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning. 

I'm also an avid follower of FC Barcelona, and have travelled over 15 countries, and have stayed in Europe for a semester on exchange too!

Feel free to ping me anytime!
