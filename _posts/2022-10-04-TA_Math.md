title: Teaching Maths as a TA
---

This blog is me reflecting back after spending nearly a month TA-ing for pre-calculus at NYU. Honestly, the only reason I wrote this was because across the incredibly crazy and somewhat diverse experiences I've had in my nearly 2 months in NY City, teaching kids in a physical classroom maths has been arguably the most rewarding. I'll explain more at the end why this has been the case for me.

Some boilerplate info : All views expressed are my own, and NYU does not back anything I write here. Also, I'll be very protective of student info, and this WILL be general. This is more a blog about what I learn't teaching maths to UGs, and less about how maths should be taught- I want to explicitly state this right here. 

Anyway, lets begin.

I have some history with teachers, and more importantly math teachers in general. My mom is a maths teacher- so technically it's in my genes. My dad thinks he's a great maths teacher - technically false as corroborated my my sister's complaints about his teaching. Neither ever taught me maths very seriously- mostly coz I didn't listen to them when I was younger. 

I have another connection to teaching- Richard Feynman remains one of my heroes I admire most, and getting the chance to teach gets me another chance to be as cool as him. He said if you truly understand something you should be able to explain it to a 5 year old. I've got undergraduates to teach, so challenge accepted Mr Feynman. 

To be continued ......
