title: My Masters application process
---

For whom is this blog most relevant? - for folks who did their undergraduate in a non-CS/Elec/Math field, and are interested in pursuing applied maths, computing or a similar domain. All views are based on my experiences, and those of people I've talked to.

Let me break this down into these subsections :

1. Whether or not you should apply for masters in applied maths/CS/computing?

2. What needs to be done to prepare to change fields

3. University and course selection process

4. Complete grade application process

5. GRE/TOEFL prep

6. Letter of recommendations

7. Statement of proposal (SOP)

8.
