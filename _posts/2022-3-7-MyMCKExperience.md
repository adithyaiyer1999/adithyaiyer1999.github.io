title: My McKinsey maneuver
---

DISCLAMER : All points mentioned in this post are my personal opinions based on MY personal experiences. I'll be protective of the projects I did at McKinsey for confidentiality reasons. Any rebuttals are appreciated, although a response back isn't guaranteed.

Let me break this into 3 parts (in proper McKinsey fashion, 3 is perfect, not too little to be un-important, not too many to be ignored). First, I'll go over how I got in and why I chose to join. Second (most of the blog), I'll talk about my experience, and third, talk about why I left.

Part 1  : Why I joined

I had no intention to join McKinsey & Company, until 2 days before the fated interview. I was fairly certain I wanted to be near tech, work on ML/AI related stuff and mostly continue in academia if given a choice. So much so, that I left the standard test McKinsey gave to all students in IITB placements midway- I didn't see myself being a consultant. Mostly for 2 reasons- 

1. I hated PPTs, more specifically making them. 
2. I hated the corporate part of consulting- having an inch perfect resume, 3 peaks, being presentable and all the show-boatery that comes with it.

For some reason they shortlisted me for the interviews, and I thought it might be good prep for future interviews (hadn't applied or Bain/BCG/AT Kearney etc either). The interviews were sort of fun, very little on consulting/case studies and more so on my communication and ML related projects. I think my inner conpetetiveness took over, and I went through the 3 rounds whithout telling them I wasn't sure about consulting. Got my selection decision a day later. 

Next few months were a little tricky- I wanted to be in tech(and had accepts to univs for my masters), but an offer in hand from McKinsey made it tempting to atleast test corporate waters. It was the COVID 2nd wave that finally made the decision for me. I wasn't going to compromise on a virtual college, and work-ex in McKinsey would help me in the future wrt job and growth prospects. Plus, most of my views on the consulting industry in general were through word of mouth from folks I knew, and I thought maybe it would be different from what I thought.

Long story short, I deferred my admit and accepted my offer to join McKinsey & Company, in July 2021. For those who face a similar situation in the future and are confused between academia and consulting, these 2 points would be useful to keep in mind-

1. Range helps- There are things which consulting or a business related job would teach you that you may not be able to get in tech. Generalist often trump specialists- ask Google or David Epstein (https://www.amazon.in/Range-Generalists-Triumph-Specialized-World/dp/0735214484). 

2. If you're not sure about your career path in the future, taking big risks early is better- much easier to face the consequences early than later when you'd have responsibilities to take care of.
