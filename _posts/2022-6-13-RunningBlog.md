title: My Rendezvous with running
---

This blog is my story. I'm no Mo Farah or Eliud Kipchoge, I'm just me. I wanted to document how and why I started running, how and why I went about making it a routine , and why I probably will continue running in the future. For the many people who've asked me how to get into running- this is my story. It may or may not inspire you to get into it, but will probably give you ideas on whether its worth it. 

As my legs lay recovering from my first ever half marathon I ran yesterday, I thought now would be a good time to blog about it. The marathon is still fresh in memory, and I'm stuck behind my laptop- mostly because of the exhaustion in my legs. Message to future me - I'm an idiot to not stretch after a half-marathon.

# How it started

I started running because of Covid. No doubts about it. I've been an eternal complainer about running. Even now, if given an option to run or to play tennis, I'd grab the racquet every single time. Competing was a big motivation in sports for me growing up, running was, and is still too boring to replace any group sport. Covid left me with no other alternatives, I either grew fat or ran. 

I needed something to force me to run, something like a tracking app or a marathon. No marathons during Covid, so I downloaded Strava. This is probably the single most lifestyle impacting app I've downloaded. Strava is less of a fitness app, and more of a fitness community. You share runs with friends, give folks Kudos! on their runs, and watch in dismay at folks running 20'ks in speeds you run 3'ks in. The important bit is the fact that you set a standard for yourself, and you visibly see yourself improving. 

Strava is about stats, so let me bring them out. Run speeds are measure in minutes/km (or min/miles if you're a lunatic), a more visceral way compared to km/hr. My strava says my first run was 2.7 kms, in 18m 24 sec, pace at 6.40 min/km. Key point to note- I ran fast then. I was exhausted by the time my first run finished, and could barely talk by the end of it. My half-marathon pace was 6.15 min/km, for nearly 10 times the distance, and aside from the fact that my legs were ruined, I could talk normally. Looking back, this is pretty frikkin awesome (my blog -> my adjectives) to see the change. 

Plus my run was shared with folks on Strava. I had publicly announced my intentions to run, and getting kudos from my 3 followers are something to be proud of. Hence I began running. 

# How I continued

Common running rules state that you don't want to increase your pace by 0.2 min/km or increase your distance by 20% in a day. Common running rules don't need to be followed for beginners. My runs varied vastly in speed in the initial stages. I found it very difficult to increase distance to 3.5km or a 5k, but pace increases were something which I felt were managable. Rule of thumb- speed=leg muscles, distance = cardio. It takes more time to build cardio, but takes roughly 3-4 days for your legs to get used to more intense workouts. By around a month (acc to Strava), I was running my 2.7km Chembur route in 17.30 min, roughly at 6.05 min/km. I think I improved more in bursts, than say a steady increase in speed. There were days when I was running at 6.30 min/km, and one day you push yourself to run at 6.10min/km. Now that the faster run is logged on Strava, you make sure you match it the next time you run. Strava is basically peer pressure and self competition on steroids.

Increasing the distances of runs were tougher. It took me roughly 2.5 months and exactly 26 runs to run my first 5k, so stats say I was running roughly every 2nd/3rd day for my first 3 months. I increased to 3.5 after 10 runs, and 4.5 after 10. 5k was a adrenaline fuelled extension of a standard 4.5k run.

One thing I distinctly remember about my early runs- the runners high. It's this mysteriously great feeling you have after you're done with 80% of your runs. You start really enjoying the run, and start running faster towards the end of the run. I would actually sprint for the last 300 odd metres to better my time, fuelled my the adrenaline.

Point to note- running can get boring. I cannot run without music. I purchased bone-conduction earphones by Aftershockz when I started running more frequently. They don't block your ears, and are largely zero-noise cancellation, meaning I could move aside when the cars were honking. 

I stopped running whenever I had the chance to play other sports. Running cardio is very transferable for long tennis matches, and it definitely made me a much better tennis player. The short bursts of accelaration required in football/tennis were something which my legs still struggled with, running cardio isn't the best if you want to play better football. 

# Half-Marathon prepping

I started running in July 2020, the first half-marathon I registered for was supposed to be held Jan'9th 2022. That's roughly 1.5 years of somewhat costant running before I reg'd for my first half-marathon. I could have run one by the end of 2020 if not for covid, but it was more so about me being distracted by tennis that I didn't register for one. I don't want to romanticize running as a sacred activity, a person should play whatever he/she enjoys the most. The unique advantage with running was the fact that it was solitary- finding 10 folks for football or courts/people for tennis was challenging with covid. Additionally, with my job in consulting, which involved crazy hours and very little time, finding time to arrange tennis was impossible. All I had time for was a 30 min jog. 

I ran most often on weekdays when I was working. McKinsey didn't give me the liberty to spend 2 hours scrambling for a court, and the Bangalore weather with the gardens was enticing to run in. I didn't cross the 7k mark till I registered for a 21k half marathon. I had probably done 10 5k runs when I had registered for the half-marathon, to be run in 1.5 months, but I was confident I could pull it off. I ran 2 5'Ks in week 1, 2 7.5'Ks in week 2, 2 10'Ks in week 3 and completed a 15K just before my Half marathon. I was fairly certain I could push my body to go till 21k. I was excited.

Then omicron hapenned. The half marathon was cancelled. Quite gut-wrenching.

I stopped seriously running for around 4 months, focusing my energy on becoming a better tennis player. Here's the great thing about running- as long as you aren't a couch potato for a quarter of a year, you can get back to your earlier running pace in about a week. By the time my next half-marathon had arrived, I was in good enough tennis-fuelled-shape to be ready to run in roughly 2 weeks. For my first half-marathon (yesterday- at the time of me writing this), all I did was run a relatively easy 10k a week prior, and let my muscles rest. I loaded up on Unived power gels, and was relatively confident 21k was achievable.
